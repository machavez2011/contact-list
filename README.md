This will be an application that will help people find campsites in national parks when planning out their camping trips. It will achieve this by figuring out your itineray and which hikes or activities you want to do at a specific national park. It will then offer sugestions based on location to those activities you are looking to do as well as other variables such as group size limit or if pets are allowed.
